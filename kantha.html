    <h2 style="color:red">Kantha of Birbhum</h2>
<p style="color: blue;font-size: 18px;">
  The art of the kantha stitch has been
passed down from mothers to daughters
in Bengali households for centuries. In
recent times, the realisation of this cultural
heritage intertwined with entrepreneurship
skills has brought a new dawn to the village
of Nanoor in West Bengal’s Birbhum
district. Even though Bolpur, Ilambazar,
Labhpur and Mangalkot nearby are also
renowned for their traditional kantha, it is
Nanoor that is leading the way.
Nanoor, located between two rivers, Ajay
and Mayurakshi, is known for the old
terracotta temples of Pala and Sena Dynasty. The nearest
railway station is Bolpur from where Nanoor is 18 kms
away. Here, around 2,000 women are engaged in kantha
embroidery which has provided them
an important income option. A number
of women acknowledge that they
have been able to overcome poverty
and young girls can now pursue their
education.
Stories and myth behind the origin of
kantha trace their history to a period no
less than a thousand years. Its images
reach back to even earlier sources of
pre and post-Vedic period. Originating
as an art form where stories or kathaa
in all their bucolic splendour were
woven onto cloth, it is believed to have
also had religious importance. This
unique art has been passed down through generations,
involving an utmost labour-intensive process as each
individual needs to use his or her bare hands to weave the
intricate stitches.
Etymologically, the word ‘kantha’
originally suggests a light quilt
used during mild winters and
cool monsoon nights. Though
the concept exists in almost all
parts of the world, this particular
form of quilting is peculiar to
Bengal, unique in its power of
imagination and functional in its
use, representing the cultural
identity and folk art of this land. It is
essentially a women’s art since the
development of kantha emerged
out of the creative expressions of
rural women as gifts for babies or
their loved ones. Several layers of used or worn out material
such as sarees, lungis and dhotis are stitched together to
make a single kantha. The colourful patterns and designs
that are embroidered on these articles resulted in the
name ‘Nakshi-Kantha,’ derived from the word ‘naksha’
which refers to inventive patterns. Each of these kanthas
represents the contents of a woman’s mind and is filled
with romance, sentiment and philosophy. Five hundred
years ago, the earliest reference of kantha in Bengal was
found in Sri Chaitanya Charitamrita by Krishandas Kabiraj.
Some symbols such as the Tree Of Life, the swirling
cosmos and the sun are taken from primitive art. It was the
Bengali housewife who helped the virtuosity of embroidery
to evolve. From embellishing her husband’s initials on his
handkerchief to sewing pieces of discarded cloth with
colourful thread to make kantha duvets, the lady of the
house busied herself with needle and yarn as soon as her
domestic chores were over and she could work at leisure.
It became a symbolic enactment of the cycle of life and its
affirmation of rebirth and revival.
Something as simple and basic as a running stitch at
the hand of skilled artists create a magical artwork and a
wonderful means of self-expression by our rural women.
And their artistic brilliance keeps finding new expression
in a range of lifestyle products. However, it is important
to note that kantha embroidery is not the primary source
of revenue for these women. Like most places in rural
Bengal, their basic income comes from agriculture. But
they devote a significant amount of their spare time daily
to kantha embroidery to augment their earnings. Like
any other folk art, kantha-making is influenced by several
factors that include availability of materials, daily needs,
climate, geography and economic requirements. From
the earliest forms of this stitch art that relied on patchwork kantha and decorative appliqué sewn with great
skill, today it commands huge respect in the international
couture market.
When the Portuguese arrived on the eastern coast of India
all those years ago, they were astonished by the simple
elegance of kantha quilts, which reminded them of their
needle-craft back home in the 17th century when their
ship, the Frol-de-la-Mar carried Bengal kantha all the way
to the ports of Lisbon. Kantha stitched shawls exported
from Bengal in early 17th century were worn by the queens
of Portugal. The traditional designs had a central motif,
such as Satadal Padma, the hundred-petaled lotus, or
a large spiral of the energetic sun. The Tree Of Life
would be placed in four corners with free flowing jaals.
The indigenous art form of kantha would have died had
it not for the efforts of a few individuals who were keen
to revive and sustain it. In early 1940s, a resuscitation
of kantha was spearheaded by
Pratima Devi, daughter-in-law of
Rabindranath Tagore, as a part of a
comprehensive rural reconstruction
programme among the local Santhal
women who were trained to produce
fresh motifs under the tutelage of
artists from Kala Bhavana. Her prime
focus was to give kantha a new look
and a new identity, popularising it
nationally and internationally.
Kantha comprises the simplest
running stitch in the language of
embroidery. Yet it is making a mark in the international
market. Anyone who works on a quilt, who devotes her
time, energy, creativity, and passion to that art, learns
to value the work of her hands. And as any quilter
will tell you, a quilter’s quilting friends are some of the
dearest, most generous, and most supportive people
she knows.
Today, Nakshi-Kantha can be viewed it its new
avatar with its roots in the traditional form of folk
art but catering to top
designers for their urban
haute-couture creations.
Nakshi-Kantha has become
a steady, thriving business
and its revival is based on
the art and craft trends,
with high international
demand for genuine hand
fashioned work.
The effect is certainly very
pleasing to the discerning
eyes that appreciates an
easy elegance, a sense of grace and a taste for finesse
in life amid the chaos of bling and braggadocio.
