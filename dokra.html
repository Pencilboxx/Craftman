    <h2 style="color:red">Dokra of Bengal</h2>
<p style="color: blue;font-size: 18px;">
  Dokra, an age-old craft, uses lost-wax
  casting technique to create artefacts
  from non-ferrous metals like bronze and
  copper-based alloys. The ancient MohenjoDaro figurine of the Dancing Girl from the
  days of the Indus Valley Civilization is one
  of the glowing testimonials to this form
  of art which dates back to over 2500 BC.
  With her hand on her hip, a multi-pendant
  necklace around her neck and twenty-five
  bangles on one arm, the Dancing Girl, a tiny
  bronze statuette in Delhi’s National Museum,
  embodies our love for accessorising. The
  bronze maiden, interestingly enough, is a
  result of early Dokra craft, which is still alive
  in several villages of West Bengal and a
  few other parts of the country. Burdwan’s
  Dariyapur near Guskara is one such village
  where everyone is a Dokra artiste. The village
  has around 133 families and their finesse
  and precision with the designs of an art so
  steeped in antiquity has earned them the
  prestigious AIACA Craftmark.
  An ancient method of making metal objet
  d’art, Dokra artefacts are singular in their
  appeal. This tribal art form, done by traditional
  metalsmiths – the Dokra Damar tribes – has
  survived the test of time and is still in use
  today. But the sheen is slowly fading as the
  Dokra process is not only time-consuming
  but also expensive because of the raw
  materials used. The artisans of Dariyapur
  have struggled to continue their livelihood for
generations as the expense, coupled with the
overall decline in consumer demands, has taken a
toll.
The journey of this metal art from the heartlands
of Bengal to the rest of the world is interesting.
Essentially, metal figurines fashioned from bronze
and copper-based alloys use the lost-wax casting
technique, known as cire perdue in French. This
lost-wax procedure for the casting of copper based
alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia,
Nigeria, Central America and several other places
in Asia, Africa and South America.
The process involved is tedious and hence a single
piece could take up to a month or two to be created.
It is essentially a complicated method, using a clay
core and a wax coating placed in a mould. The
wax is melted in the mould and drained out, and
bronze poured into the space left, producing a
hollow bronze figure when the core is discarded.
To start the process, at first a clay sample – roughly
resembling the final image – is fabricated and left
to dry in the sun. This clay core is then layered with
beeswax, nut oil and resin from the damara orientalis
tree to the desired thickness of the artefact. Soon
after, the wax layer is carved with intricate designs
and finer details. Next, a sheet of clay is smeared
over the wax coating, covering the gaps in between
the intricate etchings, forming the final mould for
the metal alloy that gets tipped inside the artefact
under fabrication.
When the metal alloy cools down, the clay and
wax moulds are broken off and the metal artefact is
revealed. The artist has to ensure that the mould
retains its shape until the final step of the process. The
procedure is certainly extremely elaborate and arduous
and requires many years of practise to master. The
final artefact can be created perfectly only when the
artist has grasped the skill of working with clay as well
as metal. This metallurgical form of crafting beautiful
figurines and art objects is not just one of the oldest
but is also considered the most advanced in its field.
Because the mould is irrevocably broken once the
finished product is ready, no two Dokra art pieces can
look the same. What is more surprising is that these
figurines have not a single joint in them!
While Dokra art originated in West Bengal among
tribals who are the main traditional metalsmiths, over
time they moved to Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh as
well as villages in Kerala and Rajasthan. Hence, the art has
now spread all over India. Most Dokra artefacts are human or
animal figurines like horses, peacocks, owls and elephants.
But the craftspeople are also known for making measuring
bowls, religious deities and lamps, even if the themes are
quite limited, given the fact that the metalsmiths do not have
much exposure beyond their personal rural lives. However, the
technique that was once used only for creating articles for the
tribesmen’s private use has now evolved and is employed to
make jewellery boxes, tableware and even interesting mirror
frames and furniture for an urban market.
It is unfortunate, therefore, that this beautiful craft is facing
an obvious decline. The steady increase in the cost of
raw material makes the end products way too expensive
to attract enough buyers. As a result, artisans have
been showing less interest and a lack of inspiration,
encouragement and knowledge of new designs. Their
inability to adapt to modern times has also contributed
to the decline of Dokra. It is true that there is still a
demand for these artefacts in international markets like the
cities of Milan, Paris and London where they are highly
appreciated by connoisseurs, but the primitive technique
of manufacture and lack of access to modern technology
causes a delay in production. Hopefully, young interior
designers and architects will put Dokra to fresh use in the
future.
