  When you think of Bengal cotton handlooms
or taant, you immediately recall their
light, airy texture ideally suited for the warm and
humid summers of this region. Taant sarees are
characterized by a thick border, a decorative pallav
and are woven with a variety of floral, paisley and
other artistic motifs. The main weaving centres are
concentrated around Shantipur and Fulia.
Under royal patronage in the Mughal era, once the
taant jaamdaani and muslin sarees became famous,
the British government tried to destroy this art to
protect the textile industry of Manchester. There
was a strong sense of identity among Shantipur
weavers. They united to agitate against the stranglehold of the
Dadni system of the British East India Company and even took
their grievances to colonial courts during the19th century. The
taant weaves managed to survive though the demographics of
the Shantipur region went through a sea-change after Partition in
1947. Hindu weavers fleeing the erstwhile East Pakistan atrocities
settled in large numbers in a concentrated area on either side
of the Ganga in Nadia and Burdwan districts. A considerable
number among them also put down their roots in Fulia and the
neighbouring village of Shantipur. Fulia is now uttered in the same
breath as Shantipur. Weavers here trace their lineage to the great
Bengal handloom saree-weaving centre of Tangail near Dhaka in
Bangladesh but, reconciling to their new circumstances, they have
now evolved their own weaving style called ‘Fulia Tangail.’
There are records of handloom saree-weaving activity in Shantipur,
a centre of Vaishnavite culture and Bhakti Movement, as early as
the 15th century. Weaving flourished throughout the medieval
and Mughal eras, and the famed indigo-dyed Neelaambari made
the Shantipur saree a household name. This unique indigo dyed,
midnight blue cotton handloom saree was so alluring that it was
called ‘an enemy of modesty’ by the conservative majority! The
characteristic attribute of the Neelaambari lay in the fineness of
the yarn and dyeing quality. Very translucent hand-spun yarn was
used for weaving, resulting in a powdery texture. A heady mix of
delicate weaving and subtlety of design, the Neelaambari was the
last word in sophistication.
Cotton weaving also received extensive royal patronage along
with muslin and jamdani weaving. While the fine muslins adorned
the royal class, cotton or taant sarees and dhotis were used for
draping the common folk. This weaving tradition continued during
the British rule, despite disturbances and disruptions, and the
decades prior to independence witnessed an inflow of modern
weaving techniques.
Today, every taant saree is characterized by the design on its
border, pallav and body, using a variety of floral, paisley and other
artistic motifs. Some of the popular traditional decorations are
the bhomra or the bumble bee, the tabeej or the
amulet, the ardha-chandra or the half moon, the
chaand-maala or a garland of moons, the aansh
or the fish scale, the haathi or the elephant, the
ratan-chokh or the gem-eyed, the taara or the star,
the kalka or the paisley, and of course, the all-time
favourite phool or an elegant spray of flower motifs.
In the history of textiles in Bengal, we cannot neglect
the Baaluchari that came much after the introduction
of the muslin. Two hundred years ago, Baaluchari
sarees were woven in a small village called Baaluchar
in the Murshidabad district. At the height of the
18th century, Murshidquali Khan, Nawab of Bengal,
patronised its rich weaving tradition, imported the
craft from Dhaka and encouraged the industry to
flourish. However, after an unfortunate flood the
industry moved to Bishnupur in the Bankura district.
Here, it prospered in its new environs during the
reign of the Malla dynasty. But this flourishing trend
later declined, especially during British rule, due to
political and financial setbacks, and it became a
dying craft as most of the weavers were compelled
to give up the profession. Nevertheless, all these
years later, this weaving tradition has gained new
ground and Baaluchari sarees are treated as
exclusive heirlooms where stylised forms of human
and animal figures are most interestingly integrated
with floral, foliage and geometrical motifs in the
elaborate pallavs and thin, elegant borders.
Known for their intricate designs, no other saree uses as
many mythological patterns as the Baaluchari. They are
dominated by characters from epics like the Ramayana
and the Mahabharata. These characters give a royal look
to the fabric. Sarees depicting the story of Lord Krishna
explaining the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna is, perhaps, one of
the most popular designs. And yet there are other motifs
that are fashioned from everyday life in the Muslim courts
and harems. This seamless straddling of two cultures is
amazing. You can glimpse princess Sita with her maids,
or a regal queen riding a horse holding a rose, or – most
dramatically – seated on a chair, her legs stylishly crossed,
a bibi or courtesan enjoying her hookah.
