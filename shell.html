<p style="color: blue;font-size: 18px;">
  Conch-shell craft refers to the art of engraving
beautiful images on natural shells obtained
from the sea. It is the shell of a large predatory sea
snail – the Turbinella Pyrum – found in the Indian
Ocean. The overall shape of the main body of the
shell is oblong or conical. In the oblong form, it has
a protuberance in the middle but tapers at each
end. The upper portion – the siphonal canal – is
corkscrew-shaped, while the lower end – the spire
– remains twisted and tapering. Its colour is dull
and the surface is hard, brittle and translucent.
Like all sea shells, the interior is hollow. The inner
surfaces are very shiny, but the outer surface
exhibits high tuberculation. In Hinduism, the shiny
white, soft shankh with pointed ends is the most sought after for
religious purposes.
Conch shell craft is, indeed, one of the oldest folk crafts of West
Bengal. The craftsmen, known as Shankhari or Sankhakar, belong
to the ancient ‘Nabasakha,’ which is one of the so-called nine
important communities of craftspeople blessed by the Divine. The
carvings on the conch shell reflect their social, mythological and
historical expressions, rendered with the help of traditional folklore
and technology. The beauty and uniqueness of this craft is difficult
to describe. As one of the most exclusive and beautiful forms of
art practised in West Bengal, conch shell craft is an extremely
sophisticated and delicate skill considered to be exceptionally
auspicious. This craft form is also very expensive and cannot be
afforded by everybody.
Each conch shell artisan has his own unique pattern of carving and
while some draw the image of Lord Shiva over the shell, others
create entire episodes from the Mahabharata on its surface.
Then, the stories of Lord Krishna also serve as popular themes for
engraving the smaller shells to give them a unique individuality. It
is very difficult to carve a conch shell, taking a minimum of two to
three months to design a single shell item. The conch shell craft is
not a new art in Bengal. Due to the state’s proximity to the sea, this
skill has being practised here for ages.
The newly wed bride in Bengal wears bangles crafted from conch
shells intermingled with those fashioned in lac for the first time on
her wedding day. The craftspersons design many different patterns
and shapes on these bangles. Similar to the chooda of Punjab,
these wristlets reflect a woman’s marital status. Traditional images
of Goddess Durga are adorned with pretty conch shell bangles to
indicate that she is the consort of Lord Shiva. The craftspersons
also design brooches, pendants, finger rings and earrings for other
gods and goddesses and also for mere mortals!
Conch shells are blown in numerous homes and temples,
especially at dawn and at dusk, to protect people from evil
spirits. The blowing of the conch or shankh needs tremendous
power and respiratory capacity. Hence, propelling it daily helps
keep the lungs healthy. Used as an important ritual
object for sacred ceremonies, it was also operated
as a ceremonial trumpet, announcing important
messages in war fields. Some of us may know
about the fabled Panchjanya, the conch shell blown
by Lord Krishna to begin the Battle of Kurukshetra.
But interestingly, each Pandava brother also
used his own conch shell in that combat that had
fascinating names. Arjuna used the Debdutta, Bhim
relied on the Paundra, Yudhishthir blew the Anant
Vijay, Nakul employed the Sughosh and Sahadev
manipulated the Manipushpak.
In Hindu mythology, the shankh is a sacred emblem
of the Supreme Preserver, Lord Vishnu. The
reverberation of the shankh symbolises the sacred
Om sound and is praised in our scriptures as a giver
of fame, longevity and prosperity, the cleanser of sin
and the abode of goddess Lakshmi, who is the deity
of wealth and consort of Vishnu. The shankh is also
one of the eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism
– the Ashtamangala – and represents the allpervasive vibration of Buddhist prayers.
Conch shell craft, a family profession, has everyone
in the household taking an active interest. The
traditions, skills and techniques needed are
confined to family members only and are transferred
within the clan through practical demonstration. Because the
conch shell surface is very hard, it is difficult to work on it or cut
it. Today the slicing is done largely by electric disc saws that are
fitted with diamond teeth. The traditional method of cutting is
very laborious. It is done with a special type of semicircular saw
with a sharp edge called Sankher Karaat. The process involves
collecting the raw material, handling the shells, shaping them
with the help of tools, engraving or embossing various designs
and then polishing and completing the product for sale.
Today, conch shells are used in a variety of ways – from spiritual
ceremonies to creating items of home décor. With beautiful
engravings etched on its crust, these seashells are renowned
not only in Bengal but all over the world. Apart from engraved
shells, other conch shell crafts include making items like table
lamps, incense holders, ashtrays, vermilion containers, spoons
and forks from the crusts. In West Bengal, conch shells are
also used for crafting jewellery items like fashionable armlets,
designer lockets, and delicate buttons, hairpins and clips. Some
of the popular spots to buy conch shell articles are Bishnupur,
Murshidabad, Malda and Nadia. Though the craft is getting
rarer, the shell industry still plays an important role in generating
livelihood for several families, blessed by the gods.
