    <h2 style="color:red">The Call Of The Hills</h2>
<p style="color: blue;font-size: 18px;">
  The culture of Darjeeling and the surrounding hills, including
the state of Sikkim, is both diverse and unique. The two
predominant religions, Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism, play
a large part in influencing the crafts of this area peopled by
the Lepchas, Bhutias, Sherpas, Yolmos, Gurungs, Rais and
Tamangs. Thus their handicrafts are quite different from those
existing in the rest of West Bengal. They express a deepseated cultural heritage in age-old traditions prevailing in these
mountainous regions to preach peace, pluralism and plenty
Several Bhutia villages have skilled musicians, painters
and authentic artists who take pride in representing
the folk cultures of the hill people. These traditional
craftspersons are renowned for carpet-weaving,
painting Thankas and preparing sculptural models in
bronze and brass depicting gods and goddesses from
Buddhist mythology, including the Sakyamuni himself
in his avatars as Maitreya, Avalokiteshvara, Manjusri
and Mahakala. Also replicas of female deities like Tara
and Palden Lhamo are very popular.
Village folk living in the foothills of West Bengal
practise bamboo and cane craft, skilled at making
beautiful cane baskets in various designs and shapes.
These baskets have multi-uses. Craftspersons also
prepare ceremonial cane hampers, cages and fishing
traps which are made with great dexterity and skilled
technique. Bamboo dowry boxes are intricately woven
and play a significant role in marriage ceremonies.
In several Bhutia dwellings in the higher regions,
traditional scroll paintings known as Thankas are
fabricated, depicting scenes from the Buddhist Jataka
tales and similar Buddhist folklore and scriptures.
These traditional paintings use paper from Tibet or
Nepal. Pounded stones and natural dyes are used to
colour the Thankas. Lapis-lazuli – a particular shade of
blue that is a favourite hue of the local craftspeople – is
obtained by grinding semi-precious stones. Powdered
gold is also used to beautify the Thanka and enhance its
value. Several Thanka paintings, bordered with Buddhists
motifs in fine brocade and considered sacred, adorn not
only private homes but also the elaborate walls of shrines
and monasteries scattered all over the hills. The technique
used is a closely guarded secret.
Kalimpong, another hill station tucked in the vicinity of
Darjeeling, is famous for its carpet-weaving by the Tibetan
community who constitute a major part of the population
and celebrate the Losar Festival in these regions with
great flare. The origins of the hand-knotted carpet can
be traced back to more than 2000 years, imported
from Persia. In India, they appeared in the 15th century,
attaining a high degree of perfection in Kashmir and other
regions, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries, under
the patronage of the Mughal emperors.
The carpets of Kalimpong, Darjeeling and Sikkim are made
of pure sheep wool and sport glowing colours. The wool
is spun by the Tibetan and Bhutia women on traditional
spinning wheels known as the Chassba. Generally, bold
colours and geometric patterns are used to embellish
these carpets. The most common is the small bedside rug
which has up to sixty knots to a square inch. However,
bigger carpets are also woven to cover greater floor areas.
The predominant motifs are those of the dragon, snowlion and the lotus. Patterns are also taken from other
favourite Buddhist iconography, including the dhwajaa
or the royal flag, the kalash or the sacred water-vessel
and the mythical twin fish. Carpets from these regions
are based on skills that are as distinct and richly piled
as their imaginative decorations. Essentially Central Asian
in tradition, for over 2500 years the patterns reproduced
were those of floral arabesques and rhomboids, with
an occasional animal design. These designs have never
become outmoded. Some motifs have a profound meaning
– the circle signifies eternity, the zigzag denotes water
and light, the Swastika implies darkness. Along with the
Tree of Happiness and Goodness, these patterns have
endeared themselves to clients all over the globe.
Darjeeling and the nearby hills, along with Sikkim, also
produce exquisite jewellery and souvenirs, Lepcha woven
bags and other bric-a-brac. Displayed in several curio
shops, there is a great variety to choose from. Popular
among tourists are choksees or small wooden tables with
vivid Tibetan designs on their sides. They are collapsible
and can be easily transported.
The exquisitely carved dragon sets of silver with gold inlay
and studded with precious stones are also part of the
jewellery collection of this region. These consist of finely
designed dragons on earrings, pendants, finger-rings and
can be ordered either in silver or gold. Other souvenirs
are prayer wheels, papier mache boxes and, of course,
the khukri or the Nepalese knife made in Ghum. With an
inwardly curved blade, similar to a machete, it is used as
a decorative item, a tool and a weapon. Traditionally it
remains the basic utility knife of the Nepalese people. But
avant-garde hostesses display khukris in their fashionable
parlours to keep evil and ardent admirers at bay!
Trinkets and handlooms are also worth mentioning, as well
as woodwork and bamboo fretwork. While the principal
utility products are blankets, woollen knitted garments and
woven fabrics, the artistic products include wall panels, fire
screens, folding partitions, Bhutan paintings and cotton
shoulder bags. Beautiful curios on copper plates studded
with red and blue stones with engravings and replicas of
deities and Bhutia chaddars in beautiful textures can also
steal your heart. Wooden masks remain a connoisseur’s
delight, bold and demonic in expression and often the focal
point of animated conversations and plush living rooms.
