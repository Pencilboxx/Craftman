        <h2 style="color:red">Mats From Midnapore</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;font-size: 18px;">Mat-weaving in India dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization
and is also reflected in Indian folklore, in which the saints
were offered grass mats to sit upon. Its socio-cultural relevance is
evidenced by references in ancient literature, including the Atharva
Veda, the Shatapatha Brahmana, and the Mahabharata. Records
from the Medieval Period provide the first information about matweaving in the region of Bengal, with both ordinary and fine quality
mats produced in the district of Midnapore.
 The premium mat, the masland, derives its name from the Persian
word ‘masnad,’ which means ‘throne.’ These mats originated in
the Muslim period of Indian history as the best floor-coverings,
produced in Midnapore with a silk weft under the patronage of
the royal community of that time. The Midnapore district village of
Maslandpur, located close to Tamluk subdivision, probably takes its
name from the masland mat. Mats were collected as revenue under
the Jagirdari system. In 1744, Nawab Alibardi Khan issued a charter
to the jagirdaars in this regard. As a result, it was
obligatory to supply masland mats for use to the
collectorate. Soon, permanent markets for mats
were established and Kasijora, Raghunathbari
and Narajol became the most important centres
of fine masland mat-weaving. Government
officials in the British period observed that a
large number of masland mats, manufactured
in Midnapore, became popular all over Bengal.
According to a census report of 1872, there
were 618 skilled workers engaged in matmaking. Records of the British Raj show that
at the beginning of the 20th century the price
of masland mats were a phenomenal Rs 100/-
or more, the finest quality maadurs being even
dearer.
Today, mat-weaving is the primary source
of income for 77% craftpersons who either
make hand-woven mats or develop loom
based products in and around Midnapore.
Few traditional mat-making families still retain
the knowledge of weaving the fine masland or
mataranchi. But the loom-based weavers have
been organised into units by local entrepreneurs.
There are around 50 of these small units across
east and west Midnapore. Besides making
folding mats, these units have diversified into
making various utility items and accessories such
as bags, folders, table mats, runners, coasters
and boxes to suit contemporary lifestyles.
Mahishyas, the weavers of Midnapore, are
skilled at creating the most popular mats known
as maadur. They weave these on uncomplicated
looms made of bamboo. The warp uses cotton
thread while the weft is a thin soft reed known as
maadur-kaathi.
Midnapore craftsmen design these ek-rokha and
do-rokha mats with great skill and dexterity. The
word ‘maadur’ is a generic term for floor mats in
Bengal. The do-rokha is thicker than the ek-rokha
mats, more suitable for use as impromptu carpets.
Masland, on the other hand, is a textured mat
on which the craftsperson designs geometrical
designs on both the borders. These designs
are self coloured but sometimes get painted in
shades of magenta. Masland mats are used to
honour important guests and relatives, spread
with pride for them to sit on and perhaps partake
of a meal.
Maadurs are sold in the local markets for day to day
use and also transported to adjoining states to be
expended for ritualistic purposes. With the shift in
market needs, the weaves are now also used for making
decorative and utilitarian items. Today, Bhagabanpur
is the hub of Maadur-kaathi weaving in
East Midnapore. Barbasudevpur, which
is the main centre, is located between
Mecheda and Digha. The place is well
connected with Kolkata. Sabang is the
largest concentration of maadur weavers
in West Midnapore. Other areas that ply
this craft are Pingla and Narayangarh.
Maadur artists of the district regularly visit
craft fairs and art events.
Maadur-kaathi, the backbone of the mats,
is a rhizome-based plant found abundantly
in the alluvial tracts of Midnapore. The
land and climate are very conducive for
cultivating these reeds. The sticks can be
reaped within a period of a year or two
once the rhizomes are sown. The main
seasons for cutting the sticks are AprilJuly and September-November. Once the soft inner
tissue is discarded, the stalks are ready for dyeing and
weaving after they have been soaked in water to make
them pliable and soft.
Maadur sticks were initially dyed with vegetable
colours. However, nowadays chemical-free dyes
are used to get more variety. The
loom is usually operated by a single
person. A length of a mat is produced
which is then tailored according to
the size of the product. The setting
process is tedious and complicated
but the end result is always artistically
satisfying. Weaving masland mats
is, however, more complicated and
at least two persons are required to
complete the process. The popular
design on masland mats are flowers,
honeycombs and various geometrical
patterns, and the process of weaving
is very much like the weaving of
cotton saris.
Palmyra leaves, shaped like fans,
are also made into mats locally
called chataais. Palm leaf mats are very beautifully
designed at IIambazaar in Birbhum district by
women belonging to the Muslim community. These
mats are colourful and sport geometrical designs in
shades of green, blue and magenta.
The traditional maadur mat nevertheless continues
to remain a permanent fixture in several Bengali
households. They linger on to adorn numerous
homes with an ethnic décor instead of woollen
carpets. And in our rural outposts, these mats can
be easily spread out almost anywhere dry to sleep
upon and, perchance, to dream.
