    <h2 style="color:red">Burdwan’s
Wood Craft</h2>
<p style="color: blue;font-size: 18px;">
  Burdwan district is rich with historical legacies.
Its antiquity is known from about 5000 BC and
belonging to the Mesolithic Age. The name ‘Burdwan’ is
an Anglicized form of the Sanskrit word ‘Vardhamana.’
Burdwan also has a connection with the Mughal Empire
through Nur Jahan. Born Mehr-un-Nissa, the daughter of
a Grand Vizier who served under Akbar, she was married
at the age of seventeen to a Persian soldier, Sher Afgan,
who was appointed Faujdaar of Burdwan. Prince Salim,
the future Emperor Jahangir, Akbar’s eldest son, fell in love
with her. Two years after Akbar died and Salim became
Emperor, Sher Afgan met with a very mysterious death.
However, three more years were to pass before a grieving
Nur Jahan consented to marrying Jahangir. Decades later,
Burdwan was chosen by a merchant family from Punjab,
based on a farmaan or edict issued by the Mughal emperor
Aurangzeb, as its administrative headquarters. And the
family’s descendants, the Mahtabs, ruled it until 1955,
much revered by the village folk.
Natungram is an hour’s drive from Burdwan station. This
small village is the hub of wooden doll makers also known
as sutradhars or narrators or storytellers. This wood carving
tradition is so deeply rooted in their culture that even
their family names reflect their profession! The last name
‘Bhaskar’ which means ‘sculptor’ indicates their heritage.
Carved out of a single piece of wood, these dolls are
characterized by their vibrant colours and distinctive ethnic
style. Their origins may have been in the famous stone
carvings of the nineteenth century, but with floods and
famine that followed the chequered history of Burdwan,
along with the rise and fall of empires, this tradition came
to a standstill. Thus, from stone, the craftsmen moved to
wood. Soon, they were making a living with the help of
these wooden dolls that they had been able to retain for
centuries, adapting to the needs of the hour but plying their
trade with renewed enthusiasm.
The dolls are mostly made from white teak wood. But, mango,
gaamar, shimul, aata and chaatim wood are also used. This
exclusive doll-making tradition, in vogue for centuries, is the
primary source of livelihood for several families involved in
the creative process, including men, women, children and
senior members of the clan. Separate sets of work are
earmarked for the artisans. Once the figurines are carved
by the village men, the women and children get to work.
Here one can see sudden bursts of creativity as the women
rely on their imagination and a riot of colours under their
control. Myriad intricate motifs and designs in multi-hues
are painted to adorn the creations. Bright basic colours like
yellow, red, black and green made with paint and a mix of
glue that comes from tamarind seeds are used to decorate
the dolls. The older generation then helps to see that the
pigment dries out properly by placing the dolls in the sun
and watching over them.
There are three to four distinct varieties of dolls found at
Natungram once they have been chiseled from a piece of
seasoned wood cut to the required length. Then the face
and attire are painted. But with changing times and the influx
of metal and plastic, machine-made goods have proved to
be the nemesis of traditional woodcraft. Previously, the art
of making wooden dolls and toys was prevalent over many
districts in West Bengal but now it has been kept alive in
only a few places.
The unsurpassed wave of the Bhakti Movement
in Bengal in the late 15th and early 16th
centuries introduced the much-revered GourNitaai dolls – a pair of male figures with hands
outstretched over their heads, singing, as it
were, the passionate keertans dedicated to Lord
Krishna. These dolls represent Sri Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu, also affectionately known as Gour,
and his close disciple, Nityananda or Nitaai.
Besides the Gour-Nitaai dolls, another divine
figurine is that of Gopinath, the guardian deity
of Agradwip, a town on the Burdwan-Nadia
border. Then there are dolls that are folk replicas of Krishna,
Shiva, Kaali, Durga, a majestic couple and even a lone bride,
so typical in this particular repertoire.
Perhaps it was the royal influence (Burdwan is a former royal
kingdom of Bengal) that introduced the making of soldier
dolls. But it is the wooden owl that stands out as a
special offering, traditionally used to worship Goddess
Lakshmi, and enjoys an iconic status among Bengal’s
handicrafts. There are many traditional Hindu families
in Bengal who still worship a pair of painted wooden
owls to seek the blessings of the Goddess of Wealth.
They are believed to represent real owls that had helped
a poor mother and her son earn fortunes by
recommending the feathered creatures to the
Goddess. Despite being poor and managing
with frugal meals, the little boy never failed to
share his food with the birds, which later stood
him in good stead. And so legend and myth
mixed over time to make these wooden owls
famous.
Earlier, the owls would be decorated with the
traditional red, green and yellow paints on a
white base, with black used to emphasize the
eyes and other features. But now varied colours are
applied as a base and its worth as an exclusive and
artistic room décor has replaced its religious appeal.
Thus, the wood owl and several other wooden dolls from
Burdwan make wonderful gifts and keep alive an ancient
craft that needs our appreciation and support.
