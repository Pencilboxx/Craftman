    <h2 style="color:red">Bell Metal
Art Of
Bahrampur</h2>
<p style="color: blue;font-size: 18px;">
  Metal crafts exhibit a very ancient lineage in India
and their origin can be traced way back to the
Indus Valley Civilization. The discovery of the small
bronze statue – the Dancing Girl created over 4,500
years ago, a rare masterpiece – at the ancient site of
Mohenjo-Daro testifies the antiquity of Indian metal
crafts all those years ago – a complicated craft
that witnessed many artisans rise and fall during
different ruling dynasties and went on to receive its
highest perfection during the Gupta Period, which
is considered as the Golden Age of Indian art. The
process of making, shaping, and treating metal
objects was perfected in this era. The use of different
types of alloys indicates the awareness that artisans
had of the characteristics of the metal. And the wide
varieties in tools specify the responsiveness of the
smiths to different needs.
There was also a profusion
of brass and bell metal
utensil production from the
medieval times, probably
under the influence of
Islamic court
and an elite
lifestyle, for a
number of new
forms of shapes
with new uses
came into vogue.
New forms
like the paandaan, itr-daan,
masaala-daan
and gulaabdaan, emerged
for regular use
in a syncretic
society, while special
items like flags for royal
processions, brass and
bronze fitted weaponry and
furniture were part of court
life.
Khagra, a neighbourhood
of Baharampur in the
Murshidabad district of West
Bengal, is renowned for its
manufacture of bell-metal
and brass utensils by the
Kaansa Banik community.
The beautiful products have
a rich sheen and
a fine finish. In
Bankura, Ghatal
and Purulia,
artisans are noted
for moulding
bigger items in an
exquisite fashion.
The poor artisans
of Chandrapur
also display an
admirable skill
of engraving
the heads of
goddesses and gods, whose
idols are made with bellmetal.
Locally known as kaansa,
bell-metal utensils like
bowls, tumblers, serving
dishes and thaalis are
still used in many middleclass Bengali households.
Important guests are served
full-fledged meals on bellmetal dishes and there is a
tradition of giving bell-metal
utensils as gifts to a bride
during her wedding, as it
is considered auspicious.
Kaansa utensils occupied a
special place in several 18th
century kitchens where the
family was seen participating
in meals, sitting on mats on
the floor.
Besides Khagra, bell-metal
utensils are also a source of
livelihood for craftspeople
in Baharampur, Kandi,
Baranagar and Jangipur in
and around the Nadia district
of West Bengal. Locks
and betel-nut cutters of a
superior quality are made at
Dhulian and iron chests at
Jangipur. The methods or
techniques that are generally
used in bell-metal craft are
chasing, delicate engraving,
repousse and embossing,
etching, incising, inlaying,
pierced work, and filigree.
Bell-metal is a hard alloy
that was originally used
to make prayer bells and
related musical instruments
such as cymbals. It is a form
of bronze with a higher tin
content that increases the
rigidity of the metal and also
its resonance. In Russia,
church bells are commonly
cast with a unique mixture
of copper and tin, often with
added silver, to produce their
unique sonority mastered
early in Russian Christian
history. In the esoteric sect
of Vajrayana Buddhism,
hand bells and singing
bells are cast with a special
five-metal alloy similar to
kaansa. Each of the metals
represents one of the five
Buddhas. A parallel alloy is
employed for gongs, chimes
xylophones and numerous
other instruments that are
struck with wooden sticks to
produce a reverberation that
echoes through Indonesian
gamelan ensembles. Similarly,
in the Nadia district – being
home to several Vaishnavite
cults – good use was made of
all the prayer and percussion
paraphernalia manufactured
locally in an alloy of kaansa.
Several colonial records
reflect that in Bengal images
of gods and goddesses,
along with prayer lamps, were
principally made in Nabadwip,
Krishnanagar and Kolkata.
These images were mainly
used for worship in Hindu
homes. Although they are
now mostly made of brass,
earlier they were made of
ashta-dhaatu, an alloy of eight
metals. This genre represents
the more classic metal works
in Bengal. The case of ashtadhaatu had to be resolved
through chemical analysis
of the relevant artefact. The
current practise in case of
specially ordered images for
religious purposes is to pierce
a hole on the right chest of the
semi-completed image and
pour down some mercury. A
small piece each of silver and
gold are later added to the
main ingredients of copper
and zinc to which sometimes
a little tin is added. But to
get away from complications,
bell-metal idols are easier to
manufacture and cheaper on
the pockets of devotees.
Metal craft reflects human skill
and ingenuity rather than the
use of power devices, and
they manifest the tastes and
demands of diverse social
and economic classes. In the
past, metal craft was resorted
to for making objects for rulers
and nobles as well as for their
subjects, for both spiritual
and secular purposes. Today,
objects are made for wealthy
citizens, the upper middle
class and humble households.
While religious and secular
demands remain constant,
objects in bell-metal have
become disparate in use and
form to meet diverse needs
