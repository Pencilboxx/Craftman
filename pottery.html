The clay mixture is then fashioned on wheels, to give it the shape of the required items, which range from simple pots to exquisite idols. The items are then dried and hardened, to make them hard and stabile.There are four famous kinds of pottery in West Bengal, viz Mangalghats, Lakshmi Ghat, Manasha Ghats and Tulsimancha.
